Which is why it's important to understand how these two channels work, and how to use them most effectively for your business. To start, you'll need a plan for what you want to achieve. You can't just throw out posts without a strategy. So, take some time to consider the following:\n\n*   \\*What are the goals of your company?\n\n*   \\*Are you looking to increase awareness for your products or services?\n\n*   \\*Do you want more leads or clients?\n\n*   \\*Do you want to sell more products or services?\n\nAfter establishing goals, consider the type of web traffic you're looking for. For example, if you're looking to increase awareness, don't post too much on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. These platforms are used mostly for personal connections and not marketing purposes. his will lead to an increase in conversions through targeted advertising, which will drive sales and generate revenue for your company.\_You can\_[buy website traffic](https://www.targetedwebtraffic.com/)\_or using SEO services and check all your website traffic on Google Analytics, see where your visitors are coming from, and track a variety of other stats to see how you're doing. If you're looking for more leads or clients then focus on optimizing your website with keywords that people may be searching in Google, like \"CPA Marketing\" or \"Personal Injury Attorney.\" When optimizing your website with keywords like this, remember that those are phrases people might search so try to include them in both the title tag of the page and within content (for example: \"CPA Marketing Companies - The Best Place To Find An Agent In Your Area\"). This way when potential clients do a search they will find your site at the top of their results page!\n\n## **Managing and measuring social media traffic**\n\nOne of the most important aspects of web traffic is how to manage and measure it. It can be difficult to know what metrics to pay attention to when you're looking at your site's analytics. That's why we put together this ultimate guide for web traffic: it'll help you identify and measure your social media traffic.\n\nTo start with, make sure that you have a social media marketing strategy in place.
